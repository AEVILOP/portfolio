## 🧠 About the Project

This is not just a simple portfolio — it’s **interactive and dynamic**.  
When someone visits the page, a popup appears asking:
> “Which side do you want to explore?”

Depending on their choice:
- 💅 **Frontend Developer** section shows my frontend projects & skills  
- ⚙️ **Backend Developer** section highlights my server-side knowledge  
- 🌈 **Full Stack Developer** section combines both sides
