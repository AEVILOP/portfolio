##  📌 About The Project

This project is my **personal developer portfolio**.  
Its purpose is simple: clearly present who I am, what I build, and what I know — without unnecessary clutter or overengineering.

The portfolio focuses on:
- Clarity over flash
- Real projects over filler content
- Strong frontend fundamentals

If someone can’t understand my skills quickly, the portfolio has failed.
