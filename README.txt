🚀 Portfolio Website

A personal developer portfolio showcasing my projects, skills, and experience.
Built to present my work clearly to recruiters and collaborators — not just to “look cool”.

🧠 Why this project exists

Most portfolios are flashy but empty.
This one is focused on clarity, performance, and real projects.

The goal:

Show what I can actually build

Demonstrate frontend fundamentals

Keep the UI clean, fast, and responsive

If someone can’t understand my skills in under a minute, the portfolio has failed.

✨ Features

Responsive layout (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)

Project showcase section with descriptions

Skills & technology overview

About section with professional focus

Simple and clean UI (no unnecessary animations)

Fast load time, minimal dependencies

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic structure

CSS3 – layout, responsiveness, styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) – interactivity & logic

No frameworks here — this project proves I understand the basics properly, not just libraries.
